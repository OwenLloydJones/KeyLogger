# KeyLogger
Just a keylogging script (C++) i have been working on and playing around with. This is something i have been doing to broaden my knowledge about C++ while engaging myself.  This is a custom script but do not intend for it to be used maliciously.

My Goals for this script:
1) Make a wokring keylogger.
2) Able to capture Both upper and lowercase letters + Numbers.
3) Able to see on the output document things such as "space" and "Delete"
4) Able to capture special characters in the output doc "$", "!".
5) Able to push the results to a website such as Adafruit or send them to an email.

  Upload of Early versions of the script. #1 - 29/05/18
    These files contain things such as a Upper and Lower case filter, allowing the document that the keys logged are saved to to     
    differentiated between upper and lower case.
    Another file is to make "Space", "Esc", "Enter", "Delete" show up on the text document in plain text so the user reading knows what is 
    happening.
    The Final doc is a code to convert text to ascii which is something that needs to be done in order for the code to be recorded in the 
    text doc.
