# KeyLogger
This is a keyloggin script that i have been working on for a while now. I have been slowing building it from the ground up. I am currently still working on the fundementals of the script which allows it to capture certain characters on the keyboard. This is something i plan on continously editing and adding to so that i can build a custom, fully working keylogging script. This script however is not inteded to be used for any malicious activity as it is just a little project i have been working on for fun. It has been a testing document for me to broaden my skills of programming and getting to know the fundementals of C++ and how it can be applied in many different scenarios. 

I have wanted to create for myself a fully functioning peiece of code that can be applied to a computer and due to its complete custom code it should be able to go undetected by antivirus software. This however does mean the customisation of the <windows.h> and <winusers.h> libraries but over time these are things that i plan on doing.

My Goals for this script:
1) Make a wokring keylogger.
2) Able to capture Both upper and lowercase letters + Numbers.
3) Able to see on the output document things such as "space" and "Delete"
4) Able to capture special characters in the output doc "$", "!".
5) Able to push the results to a website such as Adafruit or send them to an email.
6) Become a hidden background process so that users cannot see it running.
7) Ability to log website names.
8) Fully customise the libraries used, to avoid antivirus detection.

  Upload of Early versions of the script. #1 - 29/05/18
    These files contain things such as a Upper and Lower case filter, allowing the document that the keys logged are saved to to     
    differentiated between upper and lower case.
    Another file is to make "Space", "Esc", "Enter", "Delete" show up on the text document in plain text so the user reading knows what is 
    happening.
    The Final doc is a code to convert text to ascii which is something that needs to be done in order for the code to be recorded in the 
    text doc.
